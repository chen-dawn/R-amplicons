This site contains lessons for analyzing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data in R based on data collected at the University of Wisconsin - Madison through the Micro 551 Senior Capstone class. Course website and Introduction to R materials were modified from the Data Carpentry course materials (Copyright (c) Data Carpentry) on [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/). These lessons provide a brief overview of the experimental design, how sequences were preprocessed using [mothur](https://mothur.org/), and how to analyze the resulting OTU (operational taxonomical unit) table of abundances for each taxa in R.
